The first personal website I built was accumulation of hacks. This meant that a small change would cause a chain reaction of divs and containers falling out of their place. This was obviously a problem which I decided to throw under the rug. Now that I've built up series of technical experience I wanted to share them in a blog format. There are many tools out there that can generate static files but two caught my attention which are Jekkyl and Gatsby.
